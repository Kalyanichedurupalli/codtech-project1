OBJECTIVE
The objective of this task is to implement a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The goal is to use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset (or a suitable alternative like the California Housing dataset) for training and evaluating the model.

KEY ACTIVITIES
DATA LOADING AND EXPLORATION: Load the dataset (California Housing dataset in this case) and Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features
DATA PREPROCESSING:Select relevant features for the model and Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
MODEL TRAINING:Initialize and train a linear regression model using the training data.
MODEL EVALUATION:Make predictions on the test set and Calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
RESULT VISUALIZATION:Visualize the actual vs. predicted prices and also Visualize the distribution of residuals (errors).

TECHNOLOGIES USED
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

PYTHON: The primary language used for implementing the linear regression model and related activities.
LIBRARIES AND PACKAGES:

PANDAS: For data manipulation and analysis.
SCIKIT-LEARN: For implementing the linear regression model, splitting the dataset, and calculating evaluation metrics.
MATPLOTLIB: For creating visualizations such as scatter plots.
SEABORN: For advanced data visualization, such as plotting the distribution of residuals
